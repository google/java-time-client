# bazel's sandbox doesn't like the symlinks from javase/ and android/ to common/
# Without --spawn_strategy=standalone you'll see errors like
# java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: java/com/google/time/client/base/DateTimeException.java
# because the sandbox copies the symlinks then can't find what they link to.
